 Pie Chart with Percentages
```{r}
slices <- c(10, 12, 4, 16, 8)
lbls <- c("US", "UK", "Australia", "Germany", "France")
pct <- round(slices/sum(slices)*100)
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct) # add percents to labels
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="") # ad % to labels
pie(slices,labels = lbls, col=rainbow(length(lbls)),
   main="Pie Chart of Countries") 
```

This code divides pie chart by colours and automatically calculates the percentages of each part.
